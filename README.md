Breif Description: Today I did my standup and was assigned Jayvon's Figma to build out. today I worked on getting the file structure down and working on some of the html and css.
Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/p1BcHrGsq1wEIrLkMJlSzg/Untitled?type=design&mode=design&t=hQniRobuzmvkDoDg-1

Peer Reviewer: Joseph Poncini
Peer Review: Overall, a very impressive website. You are obviously missing data filling out in areas but you got really cool animations going and the format and icons look very similar to the figma. Overall, this is a very good foundation to finish a very impressive site for the portfolio, just get that data in and have your favorites list pop up on the search :)
